 GeoClean – Community-Powered Metro Issue Mapping
GeoClean is a civic-tech project designed to empower citizens to report environmental issues—like trash dumps, open sewage, or broken infrastructure—by marking problem areas directly on an interactive metro map. The goal is to bridge the communication gap between the public and municipal authorities responsible for urban cleanliness and maintenance.

Users can drop a pin, select the type of issue, and submit optional details or photos. These reports are stored in a database and visualized in real time, helping environment management teams track high-density problem zones and respond effectively. GeoClean also supports admin access for reviewing, filtering, and exporting reports to support city-wide planning.

The project integrates modern mapping tools with a clean frontend interface and a scalable backend, making it ideal for future deployment in cities struggling with waste management and civic responsiveness. It’s more than just reporting—it's about creating a culture of shared responsibility and real-time accountability.

Built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps API, Firebase/MongoDB (tech stack customizable).


Status: In development (MVP ready soon).


Use Case: Urban monitoring, civic engagement, environmental awareness, metro-city station cleanliness.
