# GeoClean
GeoClean is a civic-tech project like trash dumps, open sewage, or broken infrastructure by marking problem areas directly on an interactive metro map. The goal is to bridge the communication gap between the public and municipal authorities responsible for urban cleanliness and maintenance.
